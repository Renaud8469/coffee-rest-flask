# Coffee REST Flask API

This repo contains a simple REST API modeling a coffee ordering service. 
It is healivy inspired by this article : [How to GET a cup of coffee](https://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow)

## Code structure

For now it is an extremely simple app entirely contained in `app.py`. The other file `req.py` is used for testing purposes.
